Feature: check for cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability using arachni against gruyere
Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
Scenario: Do a full xss
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --checks=XSS --scope-page-limit=1 http://172.12.0.2:8008/login
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected"
